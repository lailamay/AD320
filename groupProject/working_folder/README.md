Group Project #1 - Sprint #1 - Liteweight Fitness Tracker (LTF)

Summary of Work:

Sanford Winslow - Login page, along with server, database and backend work
Laila Chavez - Contact page, along with server, database and backend work
Iryna Sherepot - Activity and Index pages, along with server, database and backend work
Jeremy Westfall - Git work, combined pages, very slight tweaks for presentation

List of Completed User Stories:
#6	As a user, when I scroll down, I want to see more relevant
	information

#7	As a user, when I look at and interact with the page, I expect
	to have a pleasant UX experience, especially with the potential
	for information overload

#9	IF the user, HOVERS over some element(button, picture, logo etc)
	THEN button changes color/expands/ the pointer changes its look
	to a finger instead of arrow etc other ideas

Project Write-Up:  A fitness tracker that allows users to enter data (weight, calories, activities, body type, etc.), to view, and to manipulate(edit or remove). They can view their progress and results through graphical (charts, tables, etc.) representation. Allows users to collaborate with coaches for optimal success and motivation for a nominal fee.

Group Project #1 - Sprint #1 - Requirements

Welcome to Sprint 1, Let's get Developing!

For this week, I would like your team to focus on getting the basic framework of your site together.
- Create mockup pages from your wireframes
- Create a mock data object to model your database (will discuss in class)
- Choose at least 2 user stories to work on.
- Prepare to Demo your sprint work for the class on Week 4 to end Sprint 1 and begin Sprint 2!

Deliverables to be submitted!
- Submit a link to your github repository with a brief summary of the work that was done by each developer, and a list of your user stories that are completed.

Example:
https:/github.com/<user>/myAD320Project
Team Member 1 - Worked on User Story X - Completed.
Team Member 2 - Worked on User Story Y - Still in progress, carrying over to next sprint
Team Member 3 - Worked on User Story Y with TM2, pair programming to speed up development.

Group Project #1 - Sprint #0 - Liteweight Fitness Tracker (LTF)

Project Write-Up:  

A fitness tracker that allows users to enter data (weight, calories, activities, body type, etc.), to view, and to manipulate(edit or remove). They can view their progress and results through graphical (charts, tables, etc.) representation. Allows users to collaborate with coaches for optimal success and motivation for a nominal fee.

User stories:

#1 	As a user, when I click to add my weight and I click enter,
	then I see a result on a webpage and it will be stored in a
	database

#2 	As a user, when I click  to convert my weight from kilo to pounds
	or vise versa then I see the results of the conversion

#3 	As a user, when I click on history graph, then I see a graph
	chart of past history inputs and I can change between data points

#4	As a user, when I want to pull history (my daily activities)
	then I click a box to download as a csv file to the browswer download

#5 	As a user, when I enter the wrong information into my activity
	database, then the system will warn me that it is not the correct
	datatype so that my data stays accurate

#6	As a user, when I scroll down, I want to see more relevant
	information

#7	As a user, when I look at and interact with the page, I expect
	to have a pleasant UX experience, especially with the potential
	for information overload

#8  As a user, I can upload an image file (a personal photo, logo
	or quote),then the page will reflect my changes

#9	IF the user, HOVERS over some element(button, picture, logo etc)
	THEN button changes color/expands/ the pointer changes its look
	to a finger instead of arrow etc other ideas

#10	As a user, when I want to invite a friend to use the app,
	then I click the invite button, enter email address and submit

Group Project #1 - Requirements

For this project, you will work in groups of 4 to create a Web Application using PHP and MySQL. Development will take place in an iterative, Agile style.

For week 2, we will start with a planning sprint for your project, where you will decide what the project will be, create a backlog of user stories to develop, and generate a UI Wireframe sketch of how your project will look.

The project must satisfy the following requirements:
- Serverside project code is PHP, exclusively. No python or JS
- Serverside Database is MySQL
- Project should include a way to perform all CRUD operations against a database, For example, a book wishlist application that  
C: allows users to add book titles and ISBNs to a list,
R: allows users to view their list
U: allows users to edit a list entry
D: allows users to remove an entry from their list



The deliverables for Sprint 0 will be:
- Create a GitHub repository with all team mates added as collaborators. (Will demo in class)
- In your group repo's README.md file, include a brief write-up of your what your project will be.
- An image file that shows wireframes for all planned screens of your application (Simple sketches are fine)
- Create 10 user stories to be considered for development in Sprint 1 (Week 3) (Use GitHub Issues for this)

To submit, one person from the group should submit a link to the project github repository to notify me that all the sprint 0 work has been completed. (Commits to the repository for Sprint 0 work added after Wednesday 1/16 @ midnight will be considered late work.)
